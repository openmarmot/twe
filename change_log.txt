TWE Project : Change Log

-----------------------------------------------------
October 26 2020
- made a couple small changes to wo_gun so it could be added to the test world 

# issue notes
- hit box seems bad - at least when determining what is under the mouse cursor.
    it seems way to the left

-----------------------------------------------------
October 14 2020
- moved the world building stuff to a new world_builder file


-----------------------------------------------------
October 06 2020
- added another list to world class to track which objects can be collided with 
    this is useful to differentiate between objects that are just particles
- added a basic collision square function to math_2d 
- added selection of objects in the screen space with the mouse to graphics_2d_pygame 
    this is there instead of math_2d because its more specific to the graphics engine
    and specificaly the render lists and screen space coords 

-----------------------------------------------------
September 22 2020
- removed un-needed functions to add/remove objects in graphics_2d_pygame 
- started puzzling through map loading. not sure what code file will handle that yet
    - may not be a responsibility of 'world' class 
-----------------------------------------------------
September 14 2020
- created some place holder art for weapons and various soldier uniforms
-----------------------------------------------------
September 08 2020
- started fleshing out a gun object and gun_mag object 
    - started with a mp40 as per tradition
- added inventory to the base world_object class 
- fixed a confusing logic error in wo_man and wo_player where i wasn't triggering init of the 
    base class. it confuses me why this wasn't breaking anything. very odd
- some code formatting cleanup
-----------------------------------------------------
September 07 2020
- added in simple movement for the player 
- confirmed that ai zombie rotation code seems to work great
- confirmed that world coord to screen coord translation seems to work great 
- added in 'move to target' math
- tested engine with 500 'bob' zombies - everything was still fast
-----------------------------------------------------
September 06 2020

- blew off the dust on this project .. again :D 
- started working on the input handling - trying to keep it in
graphics_2d_pygame as much as possible.

-----------------------------------------------------

- blew off the dust on this project 
- started moving pygame stuff from twe.py and world.py to graphics_2d_pygame.py 

-----------------------------------------------------
June 18 2016

- added image rotation
-the correct image orientation is apparently forward is 'up'
- confirmed that world transforms are behaving correctly.
- remember on screen coordinate y starts at zero and gets bigger as
it goes down
-----------------------------------------------------
June 18 2016

-created project
