TWE Project : Change Log

-----------------------------------------------------
March 02 2021
- more work on world_menu (lots to do here)
    - added world_menu text_queue to display via graphics_2d_pygame 
    - implemented debug menu (~) 
    - fixed some logic errors
- disabled zombie spawning on start. you can now spawn them from the debug menu 

thoughts 
- graphics_2d_pygame could use a bit of a rewrite to make it cleaner and more isolated
    ideally it should be easy to replace with another graphics library
- desire to implement my cat intensifies 
-----------------------------------------------------
Feb 27 2021
- added a new to me 'islice' in graphics_2d_pygame to display the first three lines from the text queue 
- created a new zombie object to serve as a good test object 
    - quick zombie art 
    - moved speed randomization code to the init of the wo_zombie world object 
    - speed for other objects should probably be declared in init as well 
- repurposing world_builder as a static generator that will be used to generate ALL world objects 
    - can be referenced from any object, static file not a class, no state 
- added zombie and zombie horde generators to world_builder 

-----------------------------------------------------
Feb 03 2021
- added code to graphics_2d_game to push number key events to world_menu 
    for ingame menu usage 
- started on some world_menu code - got stuck on how this is being displayed
    probably need another text queue -- but do i really want all of these to be 
    stored in the graphics_2d_pygame class? maybe i need a text object game object 

- thought - why is world menu in the world class at all? 
    - I guess it needs to be somewhere 
-----------------------------------------------------
Jan 10 2021
- created crate.png art 
- code for crate image load 
- wo_crate object  

-----------------------------------------------------
December 29 2020
- moved project over to windows from mac
- minor code cleanup in graphics_2d_pygame.py 

-----------------------------------------------------
November 29 2020
- moved graphics_2d_pygame object creation into world class to solve clean up the init ordering
- moved init for world pointer in graphics_2d_game into the init function where it should logically be 
- created a class for the world_menu that will be used to interact with objects


-----------------------------------------------------
November 03 2020
- added a text queue and some basic text handling

-----------------------------------------------------
October 26 2020
- made a couple small changes to wo_gun so it could be added to the test world 

# issue notes
- hit box seems bad - at least when determining what is under the mouse cursor.
    it seems way to the left

-----------------------------------------------------
October 14 2020
- moved the world building stuff to a new world_builder file

-----------------------------------------------------
October 06 2020
- added another list to world class to track which objects can be collided with 
    this is useful to differentiate between objects that are just particles
- added a basic collision square function to math_2d 
- added selection of objects in the screen space with the mouse to graphics_2d_pygame 
    this is there instead of math_2d because its more specific to the graphics engine
    and specificaly the render lists and screen space coords 

-----------------------------------------------------
September 22 2020
- removed un-needed functions to add/remove objects in graphics_2d_pygame 
- started puzzling through map loading. not sure what code file will handle that yet
    - may not be a responsibility of 'world' class 
-----------------------------------------------------
September 14 2020
- created some place holder art for weapons and various soldier uniforms
-----------------------------------------------------
September 08 2020
- started fleshing out a gun object and gun_mag object 
    - started with a mp40 as per tradition
- added inventory to the base world_object class 
- fixed a confusing logic error in wo_man and wo_player where i wasn't triggering init of the 
    base class. it confuses me why this wasn't breaking anything. very odd
- some code formatting cleanup
-----------------------------------------------------
September 07 2020
- added in simple movement for the player 
- confirmed that ai zombie rotation code seems to work great
- confirmed that world coord to screen coord translation seems to work great 
- added in 'move to target' math
- tested engine with 500 'bob' zombies - everything was still fast
-----------------------------------------------------
September 06 2020

- blew off the dust on this project .. again :D 
- started working on the input handling - trying to keep it in
graphics_2d_pygame as much as possible.

-----------------------------------------------------
April 12 2020

- blew off the dust on this project 
- started moving pygame stuff from twe.py and world.py to graphics_2d_pygame.py 

-----------------------------------------------------
June 18 2016

- added image rotation
-the correct image orientation is apparently forward is 'up'
- confirmed that world transforms are behaving correctly.
- remember on screen coordinate y starts at zero and gets bigger as
it goes down
-----------------------------------------------------
June 18 2016

-created project
-worked on coordinate system and world->screen transforms
-moved to using tuples for coordinates from a dedicated class for simplicity
may change in the future.
-created man.png
-created kubelwagen.png
