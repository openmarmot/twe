TWE Project : Change Log



---------------------------------
May 24 2021

summary 
- added ability to exit vehicles. this was harder and 
    more ugly than initially expected. gotta rethink this code 
    at some point when vehicle stuff is more hashed out 




---------------------------------
May 22-23 2021

summary
- work on vehicle ai 
- worked on adding math for movement when all you have is a speed and angle (for human vehicle control)
- removed a lot of the debug print code as it was really getting excessive
- fixed kubelwagen png so it is now square - this was causing visual issuses and possibly crashes
- fixed warehouse png dimensions
- bumped up bullet speed a little. the idea is to make it hard to dodge but not impossible 


kubelwagen is now driveable - however you can't get out at the moment

movement in the kubel really shows the graphic jitter issue when you drive past things 
- i think this is related to the world coords -> screen coords translation. I'll need to look into it 

the guns/bullets/health in this game are a balance between realism and playability. 
the bullets need to be somewhat dodgeable and hits need to be somewhat survivable to keep 
this playable at all - otherwise everyone would be mowed down by the mg34 soldier in the first 
couple seconds (can happen anyways :D )

---------------------------------
May 21 2021

summary 
- started working on vehicle ai 

this may take awhile. its probably going to be patterned 
after human AI but i have do new movement code for player control. 

AI control will probably be the same movement as humans, but maybe 
need a concept of acceleration/deceleration 

---------------------------------
May 20 2021

summary 
- added a basic human menu (not much in it yet)
- adjusted several distance limits in ai_man 
    - seems to fix some of the worst behavior
- renamed ai_man to ai_human (for the ladies!)
- added a couple lines to ai_squad that basically kills squad movement if
    enemies are close. 
- added distance calculations to a couple menus to help judge relative distance 
    for fine tuning AI 
- added a generic 'get closest object' to world that the AI can use 
- added routines for the AI to get consumables (medical) or run away when hurt 


---------------------------------
May 17 2021

summary 
- bug fixes/code cleanup
- realized that you could no longer pickup grenades or cheese 
    - added two wo_object lists to cover these categories and added mouse select code 

The new squad generation system is up and running 
old system : you spawn a pre-defined squad (8 rifleman, 1 mg, 1 smg, etc )
new system : you create soldiers and then the code builds squads based on the solder type and availability 

the reason behind this is i want to eventually have a database that is keeping track of individual soldiers
i don't want to track squads so that will be generated 

---------------------------------
May 15 2021

summary 
- added spawn_soldier function to world_builder 
    - basically spawns a human + equipement in their inventory 

starting a rewrite of the squad system. I want the game to 
track individual humans and dynamically squad them when they are 
spawned. need some sort of template system for squads 

world_builder is getting absolutely massive. I may break 
some stuff off into a new file but i need to think of a 
way to break it off that makes sense 


---------------------------------
May 13 2021
- some debugging/playtesting. minor 

---------------------------------
May 11 2021

summary 
- added ppsh43 (35 round mag)
    - changed soviet player spawn to use ppsh43
    - changed soviet squad squad lead to ppsh43 from pistol 
- some bug fixes 
- moved mouse object select function to world.py as it will be 
    using object lists so that you can't accidentally select blood spots 
- started adding in basic code needed for future vehicle support


---------------------------------
May 10 2021

summary 
- realized i had a mosin nagant in game already and updated 
    the russian rifle squads to use only russian weapons 
- added a basic start menu where you can pick a faction 
    - civilians start without a weapon - usually you can find one pretty easily 
- if the player is killed it sends out a ring of frags 
    i did not intend this to happen, i think it must be a grenade in the 
    inventory being dropped (which sets it off?)
- created a known_issues.txt file. not sure if i will use it or not 
- increased bullet speed again. not sure how fast i want to get.
     they are still dodgeable at the moment 

the start menu is super low effort - it just uses the same code that in-game context 
menus use. that is fine for now 

---------------------------------
May 07 2021

summary 
- added bullet spread in an attempt to reduce lethality 
    - may have made bots more dangerous
- added a second russian team 
- made player german for now to test combat -- need to make a game entry point/menu 
- added a bool in 'world' that pauses the game 
    - may be used for a future entry point menu 

next big need seems to be a start menu for the game 

there is no reaction when the player dies - something needs to happen there 

---------------------------------
May 06 2021

summary 
- added a russian rifle squad so i could start bug testing combat ai 
- made a lot of changes to soldier ai but im still not happy with it 
- added code to make inventory drop when someone dies 

combat ai was super bad when i started work today. now its just bad
I fixed a lot of bugs and cut the wait on ai think down from a max of 5 to a max of 2.
I think the whole thing kind of needs a rewrite 

---------------------------------
May 05 2021

summary 
- testing random stuff after all the changes 
- some bug fixing 
- took civilians off of zombie AI. 
    -civilian ai needs to be fleshed out more. they will grab guns but don't 
    have the AI targeting code 
- soldiers have a odd AI behavior where they walk in a line sometimes.
    - might just have something to do with how the movement code works 

if you want a gun you have to grab one quick before the civilians scoop them up 
- currently if there are no guns and a bot wants one the game will spawn one 
    - if you watch for this you can grab it first 

I thought i had unique player art but apparently its the same as german_soldier. odd 
- will have to fix this in the future 

this update will probably get merged into master as it has no game breaking bugs (afaik)
---------------------------------
May 03 2021

summary 
- fixed most of the bugs/logic errors/syntax errors in the new code 

the AI is already behaving in ways that does not make sense to me at first glance 
so i think i am getting close to feature parity with my old 3d game that this is based on 

starting to rethink the recently implemented squad spawning. Instead of spawning pre-determined squads 
i think maybe the system will keep track of individual humans and sort them into squad sizes when 
spawned in map. this makes the main unit to keep track of in the future database the human (and vehicles i suppose)

that way i can keep track of stats 

note that the new 'civilians' are currently using zombie AI - i need to change that.
civilians get the soldier AI minus the ability to belong to a squad and to attack things

at the moment civilians don't get a faction and are therefore not targeted or noticed by the AI 

---------------------------------
April 30 2021

summary 
- more work on tactical ai code 

thinking about maps 
- need points of interest that should be attacked/defended for objectives 
- need to make more buildings and ground clutter 
- need building group generation code 
- in general i need code to procedurally generate maps with building clusters and points of interest 

soldier AI could use a 'engaging while moving' 

civilians do not currently have the ability to shoot things 
- may change this in the future 

---------------------------------
April 28 2021

summary 
- hacking together more ai code 
- added world lists for german/soviet/american factions 
- added squad mechanisms to update the squad position and near enemy list 
    - this may more or less complete squad ai 


the number of lists im keeping track of keeps growing 
     but - its an effective way of keeping searches fast 

Im at the point where i need to figure out if the americans and soviets
    are on the same side or not. of course they were in ww2 - but the 
    game is set in the late war and is only roughly historical. having 
    america and the soviets fight would be more interesting

---------------------------------
April 27 2021

summary
- renamed ai_group to ai_squad to better represent what it is 
    - initially thought civilians would use this as well but i think it 
        will be soldiers only 
- some work on ai_squad 
- world_builder squad spawning code 


---------------------------------
April 26 2021

summary 
- more work on the ai_man code 
- reworked world_builder code to return the object 
    - also added a bool as to whether it should be spawned in the world or not 
    - this was needed as prep for spawning soldiers with equipment pre-equipped 

did some reading on german squad Structure
- trying to figure out if i want to keep track of every man, or 
    every squad or what 
- i need to read up on soviet organization as well - i am less familiar 
    with it 


---------------------------------
April 23 2021

summary
-a bit more work on the ai system. 
- added get_closest_gun to world
    - required maintaining a gun list 
not functioning or tested atm 

---------------------------------
April 22 2021

working on the main ai state system for ai_man 
- quite a bit more work to do here. not functional at the moment 

---------------------------------
April 21 2021

summary 
- added weapons : mg34, kar98k, mosin nagant
- added a human civilian object 
    - just uses zombie AI at the moment. civilian AI coming 
- reorg of some code 

had a crash on the rotate image call in graphics_engine 
- first time this happened and it did not repeat
- possibly to do with a random starting rotation value being wrong?

---------------------------------
April 20 2021

thinking about AI. 
I think I will reimplement the main ai concept from 
my previous game where soldiers are in a group and basically just 
follow around the groups central location. the group itself then 
makes the decisions as far as where to go, etc 

the group gets marching orders from the faction tactical ai 

Factions 
- german : major faction, in the decline 
- russian : major faction, power is on the rise 
- america : major faction - starts as maybe two small isolated areas 
- civilian : true neutral 
- partisian : opposed to all major factions, poorly equipped 

General AI Structure 
ai_faction_strategic : strategic map decision (think axis and allies)
ai_faction_tactical : tactical map decision 
ai_group : unit (squad) ai 
ai_man : individual human ai 

---------------------------------
April 19 2021

summary 
- organized the images folder with some sub folders as the amount of 
    art continues to grow 
- minor change to menus to have them display the object name 
- added 4 different german cheese 'rations' - it gives you a massive health boost. just like in real life 

I want to add more small objects although the scale of the game would 
make them too tiny to see. the compromise is to make them slightly too large 

Overall scale in this game is kind of fuzzy 
---------------------------------
April 18 2021

summary 
- created ju88 art and added it as a static model 
- small tweaks to grenades and overall damage model
- tweaked fire rates for all guns 
- added dp28 and stg44
- added a run away behavior to zombies when < 50 health 
- also added health regen to zombies when < 50 health 
- added 'civilian man' art 

will probably build out state machine ai for civilian man soon. 
also need to add more random 'clutter' objects 

---------------------------------
April 15 2021

added grenades. this was more work than i initially thought

pick up grenade like a gun and then throw with 'g'

grenades collision detect in flight and will stop and 'bounce back' a bit 
if they hit something. If they explode to close you may get hurt 

when grenades explode they throw shrapnel. this has random 
trajectories but it ended up being more or less a circle around it 
-- idk why it isn't more random 

summary 
- created quick art for a german mod 24 stick grenade, and shrapnel
- shrapnel spawn code - basically the same as a projectile for now 
- grenade ai. combo of projectile code and weapon code 
- added a generic menu because i don't want to code a menu for every stupid thing 
- slowed down zombies so you have more time to experiment with them 

---------------------------------
April 13 2021

summary 
- added object code and spawns for a couple more weapons
- added rotation and changed spawn locations for weapons a bit for variety 
- added code to drop your current weapon if you pickup a new one 
- added code so that gun ai actually gets updates when equipped which fixed a timing bug with firing 

---------------------------------
April 11 2021

summary 
- added collision checking for projectiles 
- added collision handling for humanoids
- added blood splatter as a visual indication that you hit something 

ai_projectile
- added a max flight time so bullets despawn after awhile 
- ai.update now checks collision

ai_zombie 
- elimated class and moved the code to ai_man 

ai_man 
- added collision event handler
- added health. collision with projectile removes health 
- health<1 means the object is removed.. for now  

world 
- added a new object collection for humans 
    - part of keeping collision lists as small as possible 
- added a collision checker class 

general/misc
- lots of misc code cleanup to make things easier to use 

now that I can optionally draw collision circles I would say that collision appears to work pretty great.


---------------------------------
April 10 2021

graphics_2d_pygame
- added new 'debug_text_queue' with fps and other stats 
    - always on for now, but will probably toggle from the debug menu in the future
- added a bool to toggle drawing collision circles (very helpful for debug)

ai_man, ai_gun, ai_projectile, math_2d
- added a ton of code to support projectiles 
- the gun can now fire!! ( pick up gun then press f)

misc thoughts
- need to add expiration for projectiles and think about speed and other values 
- need to add collision for bullets and see what the performance impact is
---------------------------------
April 05 2021

ai_man 
- added logic to auto equip a weapon if one is picked up 
- should weapon just be a reference to something in the inventory, or should i 
    actually remove the weapon from inventory when it is equipped ?

removed 'time_passed' as a parameter from a bunch of functions. 
- passing it from function to function in long chains was getting ridiculous
- easier/cleaner to just reference it directly when needed from graphics_2d_pygame

graphics_2d_pygame
- added in max_fps value (pygame will limit to this max). set to 40 for now 
- added in line in update method to print fps - disabled for now 
    - game currently stays at about max until zombie count gets over several hundred 


---------------------------------
April 02 2021

thinking about guns and gun mags but haven't reached any conclusions 
on how to handle it yet. 
- i think i want to abstract mags, they would be too small to be 
    easily visible on the world map 
- one possibility is to have bandoleers/satchels/etc that dictate how many mags 
    you have 
- i kinda think that i want mags to be tossed on the ground when you reload 
    - and make them non-retrievable (as mags aren't modeled as their own objects)

need to think about whether the player needs their own AI class 
    - thinking it would make more sense to combine it with a ai_man class 
        - that way player could easily jump in and out of bots
    - decision was to go through with combining. 

- some work on building out functions for ai_gun and ai_man

---------------------------------
March 28 2021
- implemented image lists so object can animate/change appearance 
    - need to come up with standard image orders 
        - for example a human object would have the following  [standing,walking,shooting,dead]
        - a chest may have [closed,open]

- made some horrid art for a warehouse to use the new image system 
    - inside 
    - outside 

- implemented a warehouse object that utilizes the new image lists to show 
    a outside and inside view depending how close the player is. 
    this is kind of hacky for now. distance from the object doesn't work well with a 
    rectangular object as you just have to use a radius

- rethought render levels and added a couple levels 
        # render level kind of a 'z' layer
        # 0 - ground cover
        # 1 - man made ground cover (cement, building insides)
        # 2 - objects laying on the ground (weapons,etc)
        # 3 - objects walking on the ground (humans, animals, vehicles)
        # 4 - objects above ground (birds, planes, clouds, etc)


i suppose the object AI could just switch the image name instead of having a list and changing the index 
    but by having a list I can keep all the image names in world_builder so they are easy to swap out. 
    this keeps the AI code more reusable 
---------------------------------
March 25 2021
- fixed gun object so it is using ai_gun instead of ai_player

-----------------------------------------------------
March 24 2021
- fixing a lot of bugs introduced in the last couple updates

-----------------------------------------------------
March 22 2021
- realized there was no strong need for child classes from WorldObject and 
    rewrote code to just spawn WorldObject objects directly
    - under this design any code that makes the world_object unique will be in the AI sub class 
    - deleted wo_crate, wo_player, wo_vehicle, etc 
    - object creation code continues to be centralized in world_builder 

note 
- need to create a debug utility to dump a txt file with object details for every object in the world 

-----------------------------------------------------
March 17 2021
- thinking about inventory and weapons systems. started fleshing 
    out inventory functions in world_object 
    - added basic item pickup to gun menu 
-----------------------------------------------------
March 16 2021
- collapsed wo_zombie, wo_player, and wo_man all into wo_man and made
    world_builder the object constructor
    - I wasn't sure passing in a imported class as a variable would work but it did 
- 

-----------------------------------------------------
March 10 2021
- added some bools to world_object to identify whether something is a vehicle, player, or gun 
    these are the three main things you can interact with at the moment 
    long term this may not be a great system 
- worked on object menus for guns/crates/vehicles

-----------------------------------------------------
March 09 2021
- created vehicle class for kubelwagen

-----------------------------------------------------
March 08 2021
- crate object stuff 
    - some code cleanup in wo_crate to make it a usable object 
    - added wo_crate to world_builder
    - added spawn option to debug menu ( hit ~) 
    - i initially accidentally set the crate coords to a reference of the player , 
        resulting in the crate following me around
- kubelwagen 
    - started adding some base code for the kubelwagen as 
        implementing some rudimentary vehicles is on the near term 
        to do list 

graphics note 
- rendering seems to be better when im on my laptop and not hooked into my
    external 4k. rendering on the 4k monitor seems to have a slight chop or jitter

- the crate looks like vinyl flooring. maybe thats where i got the texture from 

-----------------------------------------------------
March 02 2021
- more work on world_menu (lots to do here)
    - added world_menu text_queue to display via graphics_2d_pygame 
    - implemented debug menu (~) 
    - fixed some logic errors
- disabled zombie spawning on start. you can now spawn them from the debug menu 

thoughts 
- graphics_2d_pygame could use a bit of a rewrite to make it cleaner and more isolated
    ideally it should be easy to replace with another graphics library
- desire to implement my cat intensifies 
-----------------------------------------------------
Feb 27 2021
- added a new to me 'islice' in graphics_2d_pygame to display the first three lines from the text queue 
- created a new zombie object to serve as a good test object 
    - quick zombie art 
    - moved speed randomization code to the init of the wo_zombie world object 
    - speed for other objects should probably be declared in init as well 
- repurposing world_builder as a static generator that will be used to generate ALL world objects 
    - can be referenced from any object, static file not a class, no state 
- added zombie and zombie horde generators to world_builder 

-----------------------------------------------------
Feb 03 2021
- added code to graphics_2d_game to push number key events to world_menu 
    for ingame menu usage 
- started on some world_menu code - got stuck on how this is being displayed
    probably need another text queue -- but do i really want all of these to be 
    stored in the graphics_2d_pygame class? maybe i need a text object game object 

- thought - why is world menu in the world class at all? 
    - I guess it needs to be somewhere 
-----------------------------------------------------
Jan 10 2021
- created crate.png art 
- code for crate image load 
- wo_crate object  

-----------------------------------------------------
December 29 2020
- moved project over to windows from mac
- minor code cleanup in graphics_2d_pygame.py 

-----------------------------------------------------
November 29 2020
- moved graphics_2d_pygame object creation into world class to solve clean up the init ordering
- moved init for world pointer in graphics_2d_game into the init function where it should logically be 
- created a class for the world_menu that will be used to interact with objects


-----------------------------------------------------
November 03 2020
- added a text queue and some basic text handling

-----------------------------------------------------
October 26 2020
- made a couple small changes to wo_gun so it could be added to the test world 

# issue notes
- hit box seems bad - at least when determining what is under the mouse cursor.
    it seems way to the left

-----------------------------------------------------
October 14 2020
- moved the world building stuff to a new world_builder file

-----------------------------------------------------
October 06 2020
- added another list to world class to track which objects can be collided with 
    this is useful to differentiate between objects that are just particles
- added a basic collision square function to math_2d 
- added selection of objects in the screen space with the mouse to graphics_2d_pygame 
    this is there instead of math_2d because its more specific to the graphics engine
    and specificaly the render lists and screen space coords 

-----------------------------------------------------
September 22 2020
- removed un-needed functions to add/remove objects in graphics_2d_pygame 
- started puzzling through map loading. not sure what code file will handle that yet
    - may not be a responsibility of 'world' class 
-----------------------------------------------------
September 14 2020
- created some place holder art for weapons and various soldier uniforms
-----------------------------------------------------
September 08 2020
- started fleshing out a gun object and gun_mag object 
    - started with a mp40 as per tradition
- added inventory to the base world_object class 
- fixed a confusing logic error in wo_man and wo_player where i wasn't triggering init of the 
    base class. it confuses me why this wasn't breaking anything. very odd
- some code formatting cleanup
-----------------------------------------------------
September 07 2020
- added in simple movement for the player 
- confirmed that ai zombie rotation code seems to work great
- confirmed that world coord to screen coord translation seems to work great 
- added in 'move to target' math
- tested engine with 500 'bob' zombies - everything was still fast
-----------------------------------------------------
September 06 2020

- blew off the dust on this project .. again :D 
- started working on the input handling - trying to keep it in
graphics_2d_pygame as much as possible.

-----------------------------------------------------
April 12 2020

- blew off the dust on this project 
- started moving pygame stuff from twe.py and world.py to graphics_2d_pygame.py 

-----------------------------------------------------
June 18 2016

- added image rotation
-the correct image orientation is apparently forward is 'up'
- confirmed that world transforms are behaving correctly.
- remember on screen coordinate y starts at zero and gets bigger as
it goes down
-----------------------------------------------------
June 18 2016

-created project
-worked on coordinate system and world->screen transforms
-moved to using tuples for coordinates from a dedicated class for simplicity
may change in the future.
-created man.png
-created kubelwagen.png
-----------------------------------------------------
