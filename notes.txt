-- Code Style ----------------------------
kinda follow pep8 : https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#introduction

leaning towards using underscores in variable and method names. its very readable 

-- Coordinate System ----------------------

world_coords=(x,y) : ?

screen_coords=(x,y) : 0,0 is the upper left coords. centered on player object

--Design Notes-----------------------------


- on naming the sides.. -
In world war 2 were soldiers from the soviet union referred to as russians or soviets?
The Soviet Union was a multi-ethnic state, and its armed forces included both Russian
 and other nationalities. So during World War II they would have been known collectively
  as "Soviet" rather than just “Russian”.

Units 
- for now I am using a square foot grid for drawing images 
- in game units will be metric where possible 
  - note currently a lot of variables do match real world units
