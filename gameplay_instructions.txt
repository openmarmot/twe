------- General Tips --------------------

# identifying the player 
- the player is always in the center of the screen 

# you can click on yourself or hit tab to pull up a context menu
- this is how you access your inventory 

# gun aim 
- having your cursor closer to your target is generally more accurate 
- guns have a bit of spray 

# grenade stuff 
- grenades are very dangerous !!
- grenades can bounce off objects 
- grenades can be thrown back 

# squad stuff 
- you can click on a bot and ask it to join your squad 
    - it will then follow you when it doesn't have more important tasks 

# autoplay 
- if you don't touch any controls for awhile the ai takes over. 
- this will stop as soon as you hit a key 

# to interact with an object you have to drop it from your inventory first 
- this will probably be changing 

# communication 
- if you are near bots you will occasionally see things they are 
    saying in the upper left corner of the screen 


--------- Getting Started ----------------

I recommend choosing 'civilian' as a start. 
- wander around a bit 
- try to find a vehicle as walking is tedious 
- investigate crates for items 
- click on a couple other civilians and ask them to join you 
- head to the middle of the map and watch the main factions fight 
- grab a weapon off a dead body
