------- General Tips --------------------

# identifying the player 
- the player is always in the center of the screen 

# hit tab to bring up either the player menu or the menu for the vehicle you are in 
- this is how you access your inventory 

# gun aim 
- having your cursor closer to your target is generally more accurate 
- guns have a bit of spray 

# grenade stuff 
- grenades are very dangerous !!
- grenades can bounce off objects 
- grenades can be thrown back 

# squad stuff 
- you can click on a bot and ask it to join your squad 
    - it will then follow you when it doesn't have more important tasks 
- you can disband your current squad from the player menu 

# some object interaction requires dropping the object on the ground first

# communication 
- if you are near bots you will occasionally see things they are 
    saying in the upper left corner of the screen 

# vehicles 
- if you are in a vehicle you can bring up the vehicle menu with tab 
    - this is sometimes easier than selecting it due to multiple objects overlapping 


--------- Getting Started ----------------

I recommend choosing 'civilian' as a start. 
- wander around a bit 
- try to find a vehicle as walking is tedious. A bicycle is a good option.
- investigate crates for items 
- click on a couple other civilians and ask them to join you 
- head to the middle of the map and watch the main factions fight 
- grab a weapon off a dead body
