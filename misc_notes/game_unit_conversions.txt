For determining size when creating images it is best to use a diagram image and scale by width. 
It is never clear whether length measurements include gun barrels and there is a lot of variation of length measurements

# -- game units --

# distance 
1 foot = 8.0608 game units 
1 game unit - 0.124 feet 

# speed 
1 mile per hour = 11.84 game units per second 
1 game unit per second = 0.08484 miles per hour 

# max offroad speed for heavy vehicles 
15 mph = 177.6

# -- weapons --
# ! Note:  effective distances compressed somewhat to keep the game playable 

projectile flight time is auto calculated as range/projectile speed

# rifles and machine guns 
range : 100 yards = 300 feet = 2418 game units

# assault rifles 
range : 75 yards = 225 feet = 1813 game units

# submachine guns
range : 50 yards = 150 feet = 1209 game units

# pistols
range : 25 yards = 75 feet = 604 game units


# panzerfaust 60
range : 1209 units

# panzerfaust 100
range : 1813


# vehicle cannons 
This is compressed for game play considerations 
game units to real life units for determining penetration 

game unit -> meters conversion for penetration data 
0 - > 0 meters
500
1000 - 500 meters
1500
2000 -> 1000 meters
2500
3000 -> 1500 meters
3500 
4000 -> 2000 meters
