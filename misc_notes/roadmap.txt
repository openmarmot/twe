A roadmap / list of ideas.
this is not a full list of what is in game, it is just a way for me to keep track of ideas 


# factions 
- add minor factions 
- make faction relationships dynamic. 
- 'civilian' partisan factions

# campaign mode specific
- follow an individual soldier 
- bank accounts + bank interface
- lock spawning down to a specific faction that you choose 

# tactical / world mode specific 
- maps 
    - map should be moved from debug to a real implementation 
    - should have colors to represent who is owning what
    - maybe only updates when you are in radio contact
- binoculars 
    - enables more zoom levels 
- (done) better vehicle hit tracking 
    - able to turn on a mode that shows each hit 
    - each hit has a line showing the angle 
    - color of line indicates penetration or bounce 

# people / units 
- all humans probably need to be resized 
- luftwaffe ground troops 
- soviet tank / afv crew 
- german tank / afv crew 
- german ss camo uniforms 
- more civilians 

# vehicle stuff 
- (done) gunners should be able to ask the driver to pause (so they can shoot)
- (done) gunners should be able to ask the driver to rotate and then pause (for shooting/angling)
- tanks should be able to rotate without moving forwards 
- (done) gunners should be able to switch between tank round types 
- (done) stabilization / lack of should be taken into account with gun accuracy
