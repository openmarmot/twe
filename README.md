ww2 eastern front sim 

TWE is short for 'To Whatever End' which was the title of a game I worked on from about 2007-2010.
The game was written in C# with the Microsoft XNA graphics framework and was going to be a open ended world war 2 eastern front simulation.
Sometime in 2010 I lost all the code due to a accidentally formatting the NAS where it was stored.

This repo is a fresh start at TWE using Python3 and Pygame. This time around I'm using 2d as I found making models and doing animation was a huge time 
sink on the old game that I didn't really enjoy. It is written completely from scratch based on my memory of previous game engines I've made. I will put reference notes in the code where possible when I copy significant code from the internet.

General Concepts
- fun comes from open world and emergent game play - game is not focused on player
  the focus is on 2 AI sides fighting eachother.
- eastern front roughly 1944-1945. roughly historical
- two modes : real time tactical environment and a map
- map size is not limited, each tile with be generated as needed
- not balanced on purpose. russian advantage as existed in the real life time period
- empasis on iron man mode. strategic game doesn't start over when player dies they just spawn again

Progress
- Strategic Mode
- Tactical Mode
- Engine 
  - just getting started with the basics

License / Whatever
- I want to do this project completely by myself to improve my python skills and just as a fun hobby. However - I put it on github for a reason. Feel free to copy code from it if you find it useful. If you use a lot of code I'd appreciate a little shout out or note as to where you got it. Thanks!
