Some issues that I am aware of 

- (fixed??) after you die if you respawn and click on your player you are identified as 'ppk'. this clears up after awhile 

- multiple issues around entering and exiting vehicles and menus 
    - possible to enter a vehicle and have the player still drawn on top of it 
    

- when humans die they sometimes aren't in the members list of the squad they are assigned to and are thus unable
    to remove themselves 

- objects are the wrong size 
    certain circumstances such as exiting a vehicle can cause objects to be the wrong size for awhile 

- graphics jitter 
    when moving there is a very noticeable small oscillation of every object 
        -especially noticeable when a lot of objects are close together 
    - this probably is due a rounding or conversion with world to screen coords thats isn't precise enough
