Some issues that I am aware of 


- objects are the wrong size 
    certain circumstances such as exiting a vehicle can cause objects to be the wrong size for awhile 

- graphics jitter 
    when moving there is a very noticeable small oscillation of every object 
        -especially noticeable when a lot of objects are close together 
    - this probably is due a rounding or conversion with world to screen coords thats isn't precise enough
