Some issues that I am aware of 


Minor Issues 
- when grenades are thrown it seems they are not removed from inventory 
    - inventory removal needs cleanup



# ----- Major Issues -----

- occasinonal crash on start with some sort of render math error 
    File "/home/andrew/git/twe/code/engine/graphics_2d_pygame.py", line 216, in render
        self.screen.blit(self.get_rotated_image(self.images[c.image_list[c.image_index]],c.rotation_angle), (x-w/2, y-h/2))
    File "/home/andrew/git/twe/code/engine/graphics_2d_pygame.py", line 337, in get_rotated_image
        rot_image = rot_image.subsurface(rot_rect).copy()
    ValueError: subsurface rectangle outside surface area
    - NOTE - i think this is due to images that are not square 

- graphics jitter 
    when moving there is a very noticeable small oscillation of every object 
        -especially noticeable when a lot of objects are close together 
    - this probably is due a rounding or conversion with world to screen coords thats isn't precise enough 


- collision seems to have a bias to the right side. 
    this suggests either i have a +/- flipped or the math is just wrong 
    - if you fire from the left of the house the dirt will pile up mid house 
    - if you fire from the right of the house the dirt piles up right of the house by a good bit
