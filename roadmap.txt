A roadmap / list of ideas.
this is not a full list of what is in game, it is just a way for me to keep track of ideas 

# campaign mode 
- follow an individual soldier 
- bank accounts + bank interface 

# tactical / world mode 

- maps 
    - map should be moved from debug to a real implementation 
    - should have colors to represent who is owning what
    - maybe only updates when you are in radio contact
- binoculars 
    - enables more zoom levels 
- better vehicle hit tracking 
    - able to turn on a mode that shows each hit 
    - each hit has a line showing the angle 
    - color of line indicates penetration or bounce 

# people / units 
- all humans probably need to be resized 
- luftwaffe ground troops 
- soviet tank / afv crew 
- german tank / afv crew 
- german ss camo uniforms
