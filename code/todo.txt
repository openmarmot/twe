========= Code Cleanup ================================
- i need to pick a style. maybe try PEP8?


======== Engine Stuff ====================================

- need some basic collision modeling 

- need some kind of persistent particle handling for brass and other stuff 

- need a frames per second (FPS) count / display

- need a simple gui menu system for debug console stuff 

- is determining whether to render stuff based on if its viewable worth the bother?
    seems like a lot of work to do each update cycle

- need some sort of world_objects bool to designate an item that will never get added to world 
    small stuff that is to small to bother rendering like bullets, gun mags, food, small parts etc 
    should only exist in inventories of other world_objects 

======== Tactical Mode Stuff =============================

-- ART --
- need some sort of container to hold objects that are too small to render in the world 

- gun and gun mag world_objects need to be finished
    - does firing the gun take place in the gun class, or is it a function 
        of soldier AI ?


======= Strategic Mode (MAP) Stuff =======================
